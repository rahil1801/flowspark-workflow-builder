I want you to build a production-ready full-stack web application called Workflow Builder Lite.

This must be cleanly structured, deployable on Vercel, and use MongoDB and Groq LLM.

Do NOT overcomplicate it. Keep it clean, modular, and production-ready.

🔥 PROJECT GOAL

Build a web app where a user can:

Create a workflow (2–4 steps)

Run the workflow on input text

See output of each step

See last 5 runs

View a health/status page

🧠 TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Frontend:

Next.js (App Router)

TailwindCSS

TypeScript

Axios or fetch API

Backend:

Next.js API routes (serverless functions)

Node.js runtime

Mongoose for MongoDB

Database:

MongoDB Atlas (cloud)

Use Mongoose ODM

LLM:

Groq API

Model: llama3-8b-8192 (or latest stable free model)

Use official Groq SDK or fetch

Hosting:

Must be deployable fully on Vercel

No external backend server

Everything inside Next.js project

Environment variables:

GROQ_API_KEY

MONGODB_URI

Include:

.env.example file

🧩 CORE FEATURES
1️⃣ Create Workflow

Workflow model:

{
  name: string,
  steps: [
    {
      type: "clean_text" | "summarize" | "extract_key_points" | "tag_category"
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Date
}

Validation:

Minimum 2 steps

Maximum 4 steps

Name required

2️⃣ Run Workflow

User selects workflow and provides input text.

Execution logic:

currentText = input


for each step:
    if clean_text → normalize string
    else → call Groq with step-specific prompt
    store output
    currentText = output

Store in Run model:

{
  workflowId,
  inputText,
  stepOutputs: [
    { stepType, output }
  ],
  finalOutput,
  createdAt
}
3️⃣ History Page

Fetch last 5 runs sorted by createdAt descending

Show:

Workflow name

Input preview

Final output preview

Timestamp

4️⃣ Health Endpoint

Route: /api/health

Return:

{
  backend: "healthy",
  database: "connected" | "error",
  llm: "connected" | "error"
}

Database check:

Try mongoose connection

LLM check:

Send small test prompt like:
"Respond with the word OK only."

🤖 GROQ INTEGRATION

Create helper in lib/groq.ts

Function:
callGroq(prompt: string): Promise<string>

Use:

POST to https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Model: llama3-8b-8192

Temperature: 0.3

Handle:

API failure

Rate limit

Timeout

Return clean text output only.

🧠 STEP PROMPTS

Summarize:
"Summarize the following text clearly and concisely:\n\n{input}"

Extract key points:
"Extract the key bullet points from the following text:\n\n{input}"

Tag category:
"Assign a category label to this text from: Business, Tech, Health, Education, Other.\n\nText:\n{input}"

Keep prompts simple and deterministic.

🎨 FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

UI must be clean and minimal.

📦 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

Must work on Vercel serverless

MongoDB Atlas required

No local file storage

Use caching safe patterns

Ensure Mongoose connection reuse (prevent multiple connections)

🧠 Important Advice

After Replit generates it:

DO NOT blindly deploy.

You must:

Review Mongo connection logic

Check serverless connection reuse

Test Groq call manually

Verify build works

Test health endpoint

Check environment variables are not hardcoded
